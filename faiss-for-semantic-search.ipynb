Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says in July he may start the process of applying Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley. Such a move was effectively green-lighted by Donald Trump\\'s peace plan. Mr Trump\\'s Vision for Peace, released in January, also envisages a Palestinian state in the remaining 70% of the West Bank, all of Gaza, and with its capital on the fringes of East Jerusalem. The Palestinians - who claim all of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem - have dismissed the plan as biased towards Israel and a denial of their rights. Israel has occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war. It pulled its troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005, but the UN says its occupation there has not ended. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel and the Trump administration dispute this. What do the UN experts say? \"The annexation of occupied territory is a serious violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the Geneva Conventions, and contrary to the fundamental rule affirmed many times by the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly that the acquisition of territory by war or force is inadmissible,\" said the 47 experts, who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council. They added that the Israeli occupation was already a \"source of profound human rights violations against the Palestinian people\", and that they \"would only intensify after annexation\". \"Israel has recently promised that it will maintain permanent security control between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River. Thus, the morning after annexation would be the crystallisation of an already unjust reality: two peoples living in the same space, ruled by the same state, but with profoundly unequal rights. This is a vision of a 21st Century apartheid.\" The experts noted that Israel had annexed occupied land in East Jerusalem in 1980 and the Syrian Golan Heights in 1981, and that on both occasions the UN Security Council had condemned the actions but taken \"no meaningful countermeasures\". \"This time must be different,\" they added. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli government. However, an unnamed Israeli diplomatic source told the Times of Israel that the statement \"does nothing to help finding a solution to the conflict or to create a constructive dialogue between the parties\". The source also said that some of the experts \"have nothing to do with the region or the rights the statement deals with\". The secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Saeb Erekat, welcomed the experts\\' statement as \"a reminder for the international community of its responsibilities, of the gravity of the situation and of the urgency to implement accountability measures to end the illegal colonial-settlement enterprise\". What is the Israeli government\\'s plan? Prime Minister Netanyahu says he wants to \"apply Israeli sovereignty\" to the parts of the West Bank which contain the Jewish settlements, as well as most of a swathe of land along the West Bank\\'s boundary with Jordan, known as the Jordan Valley. Palestinians in the Jordan Valley will be exempt from annexation, and reports say the same exclusion will to apply to Palestinians in other annexed parts of the West Bank. The areas earmarked for annexation (the precise contours of which are being mapped by Israel and the US) may comprise about 30% of the West Bank, according to reports. Mr Netanyahu might initially act to annex just the settlements, which could amount to only 3%, and the remaining 27% later on once the boundaries are agreed with Washington. Why does it intend to act now? Israel claims historical and religious rights to the West Bank as the ancestral land of the Jewish people. It also says its presence there - especially in the Jordan Valley - is strategically vital for its self-defence. It says settlements are not an obstacle to peace and that they would remain part of Israel under any peace deal with the Palestinians, whether they are annexed now or not. Mr Netanyahu has long championed the settlements and through annexation wants to remove any doubt as to their fate, something which strongly appeals to his political base. Until recently, Mr Netanyahu would have faced solid opposition among the international community to such a move. However, President Trump\\'s plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians allows for Israel to \"incorporate\" all the settlements - something no previous US administration had countenanced. It is possible that Mr Netanyahu wants to get it done before the US elections in November in case Mr Trump\\'s rival Joe Biden - who opposes annexation - is elected and reverses US policy.'}\n\t {'article': 'What is happening between Israelis and Palestinians? There has been a wave of stabbings and some gun attacks on Israelis by Palestinians since early October, and one apparent revenge stabbing by an Israeli. The attacks, some of which have been fatal, have struck in Jerusalem, across Israel and in the occupied West Bank. Israel has tightened security and clashed with rioting Palestinians, leading to deaths on the Palestinian side. There has also been associated violence in the border area inside the neighbouring Gaza Strip. Jeremy Bowen: Fear and loathing in holy city Can Israel and the Palestinians contain spiralling violence? \\'What are they thinking? Paranoia between Israelis and Palestinians deepens What\\'s behind the latest unrest? Violence between the two communities has spiralled since clashes erupted at a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site in mid-September. It was fuelled by rumours among Palestinians that Israel was attempting to alter in favour of Jews a delicate long-standing religious arrangement governing the site. Israel repeatedly dismissed the rumours as incitement. Soon afterwards, two Israelis travelling with their four children were shot dead by Palestinians in the West Bank. Two days later the stabbing attacks began. Both Israel and the Palestinian authorities have accused one another of doing nothing to protect each other\\'s communities. Israel says the Palestinian leadership is inciting attacks, and that the attackers are driven not by political frustration but by a radical religious ideology which opposes Israel\\'s very existence. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has blamed \"acts of aggression\" by the Israeli authorities and Jewish settlers for the latest violence. But isn\\'t there more to it than that? Yes. Much more. The current violence stems from decades of unresolved conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. At its most basic, it is a fight over land and national rights. There are rival and seemingly incompatible historical narratives. The Palestinian position is that Israel was created on their land in 1948, turning many into refugees, and further occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, in the 1967 Middle East war. They say any hoped-for future Palestinian state is being undermined by Israeli settlement-building in the occupied territories. The settlements are seen as illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Added to this is Israel\\'s expansion in East Jerusalem, where the proportion of Jewish Israeli inhabitants has swelled compared to the number of Palestinian residents, and where Palestinian districts suffer from poor infrastructure and services. Israel\\'s counter-position is that its right to exist is incontestable and that the Palestinian refugee problem is the result of wars forced on it by Arab neighbours. It says the Palestinian leadership - despite officially recognising Israel - have not proven they are willing to accept its permanence nor give up violence to achieve their aims. Peace talks aimed at ending the conflict by creating a Palestinian state alongside Israel have repeatedly collapsed over the years and many on both sides have lost faith in the process. Are the attacks being driven by social media? While there is no clear evidence that the attacks have been centrally organised, some Palestinians have taken to social media to champion them. Posts praising and encouraging attacks on Israelis have emerged on YouTube and Facebook, while Twitter hashtags including \"Jerusalem Intifada\" or \"Intifada of the Knives\" are gaining traction among Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin has described the inflammatory use of social media as \"Osama Bin Laden meets [Facebook founder] Mark Zuckerberg\". A staged online video in the name of Hamas, the militant group which dominates Gaza, which portrayed an Arab bystander stabbing two \"Jews\" for bullying Arab children and called for a new intifada, was removed from Hamas\\' YouTube channel after Israel\\'s foreign ministry complained that it glorified violence. Many of the attacks and aftermath have been filmed on mobile phones and CCTV, getting quickly uploaded and shared. Israeli officials have expressed fear that images of assailants being shot could fuel anger and inspire further attacks. Experts have also noticed a marked increase in anti-Arab rhetoric on Israeli social media sites, according to Israel\\'s Haaretz newspaper. It says the use of inciteful language among Israelis on the internet soared in the wake of the first stabbing attacks. Is this a new Palestinian intifada? There have been two organised intifadas, or uprisings, by Palestinians against Israeli occupation, in the 1980s and early 2000s. With peace talks moribund, some observers have questioned whether we are now seeing a third. The stabbing attacks seem to be spontaneous and although they have been praised by militant groups and supporters of Mahmoud Abbas\\'s Fatah faction on social media, Mr Abbas has said Palestinians are not interested in a further escalation. However, there is a danger that the attacks could gain momentum and become orchestrated by militant groups, and unable to be reined in by the recognised authorities. What is the East Jerusalem connection in all of this? Most of the attackers have come from East Jerusalem. Israel has occupied the sector since 1967 and considers the entire city its capital, but this is not recognised by the international community. There are about 300,000 Palestinians in East Jerusalem, all of whom have so-called \"permanent residence\" status, meaning they can live and work in Israel and, inter alia, receive the same social benefits and health insurance as Israelis. They can apply for full citizenship, but most have chosen not to, preferring not to recognise Israeli sovereignty. Some 200,000 Jewish citizens live in 12 settlements in East Jerusalem. They are widely considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, but Israel says the city will never again be divided. Arguably the most contentious issue between Israel and the Palestinians is the fate of a site in the Old City area of East Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. The compound is revered by Jews as the site of two biblical temples and is the holiest site in Judaism. It also contains the al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest shrine in Islam. Sensitivities around what happens there means it is a continual source of religious and political tension, sometimes spilling over into violence. What makes Jerusalem so holy?'}\n\t {'article': 'The Israeli military said troops had opened fire when people attempted to breach the fence on the frontier. The protesters are demanding that refugees be allowed to return to ancestral lands that are now in Israel. But Israel says the militant group Hamas, which dominates Gaza, is staging the rallies in order to launch attacks. UN Secretary General António Guterres called on all parties to \"avoid confrontation and exercise maximum restraint\" after 16 people were killed and hundreds of others wounded during similar unrest a week ago. One of those killed in the latest unrest was Yasser Murtaja, a journalist with the Gaza-based Ain Media agency, the health ministry in Gaza said. Piles of tyres were set on fire in an attempt to create a smokescreen to block the view of Israeli snipers, as thousands of protesters gathered at five sites along the 65km-long (40-mile) Israel-Gaza border for fresh protests on Friday. \"Israel took everything from us, the homeland, freedom, our future,\" 27-year-old protester Samer told Reuters news agency. \"I have two kids - a boy and a girl - and if I die, God will take care of them.\" Protesters threw stones and firebombs at troops deployed on berms on the Israeli side of the frontier, the Israeli military said, and multiple attempts were made to break through the border fence. \"Our forces are using riot disposal means and live fire in accordance with the rules of engagement,\" it added. Gaza\\'s health ministry said a 16-year-old boy was among those killed by Israeli gunfire, and that more than 1,300 other people were wounded. The first death reportedly occurred east of Khan Yunis, in the south of the territory. Israel\\'s Army Radio cited the military as saying a large group of people had attempted to rush the border fence and that troops had opened fire to stop them. Hamas and other groups organising the six-week protest campaign, dubbed the Great March of Return, say they are peacefully calling for the right of Palestinian refugees to return to land they fled from or were forced to leave in 1948, when Israel was created. The Israeli government has long ruled out any right of return and says terrorists are using the cover of the protests to try to cross illegally into its territory. Palestinians say unarmed protesters were shot last week while posing no threat, and the UN and EU have called for an independent inquiry. A spokeswoman for the UN high commissioner for human rights warned that, under international law, firearms could be used only in cases of extreme necessity, as a last resort and in response to an imminent threat of death or risk of serious injury. The Israeli human rights group B\\'Tselem called on Israeli soldiers to refuse to open fire on unarmed demonstrators. The US blamed Palestinian leaders \"who call for violence or who send protesters - including children - to the fence, knowing that they may be injured or killed\". The Israeli foreign ministry has said most of those killed last week were members of Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and EU. Hamas has acknowledged that some belonged to its military wing, but said they were protesting \"side-by-side with their people\". The group has said it will pay $3,000 (£2,140) to the family of anyone shot dead by Israeli troops at the protests. Hamas official Mohammed Thuraya denied the group was putting a \"price tag\" on casualties. \"This is our duty to our people, to ease the suffering of our citizens,\" he told the New York Times.'}\n\t {'article': 'It envisages a Palestinian state and recognition of Israeli sovereignty over settlements in the occupied West Bank. Mr Trump said Jerusalem would remain Israel\\'s \"undivided\" capital, but the Palestinian capital would \"include areas of East Jerusalem\". Reacting to Tuesday\\'s announcement, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Jerusalem was \"not for sale\". \"All our rights are not for sale and are not for bargain,\" he added. Palestinians took to the streets on Wednesday as part of a \"day of rage\" called by political factions. The Palestinian health ministry said three people were injured by live fire in clashes between protesters and Israeli security forces near Ramallah in the northern West Bank. They are in a stable condition. Several people were also injured by rubber-coated bullets during a protest in the village of Abu Dis, in the eastern suburbs of Jerusalem, and one person was hit by a rubber bullet near Arroub camp in the southern West Bank, according to the Palestinian Wafa news agency. Meanwhile, Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin said a cabinet vote on whether to apply Israeli sovereignty to most Jewish settlements in the West Bank, the strategic Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea had been delayed for several days for technical and procedural reasons. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said the vote would take place on Sunday. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel\\'s 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel - and the US under the Trump administration - dispute this. The Jordan Valley is a fertile strip of land running along the border with Jordan that makes up almost 30% of the West Bank. Palestinians say the valley would form an integral part of the land that they want for a future state. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Trump administration had simply \"copied and pasted\" the steps that Mr Netanyahu wanted to see implemented. \"It\\'s about annexation, it\\'s about apartheid,\" he said. \"Moving to the de jure annexation of settlements is something that was given the green light yesterday.\" Mr Trump\\'s blueprint for solving one of the world\\'s longest-running conflicts was drafted under the stewardship of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. What did Mr Abbas say? Speaking on Tuesday, he said it was \"impossible for any Palestinian, Arab, Muslim or Christian child to accept\" a Palestinian state without Jerusalem as its capital. \"We say a thousand times, no, no, no,\" he said. \"We rejected this deal from the start and our stance was correct.\" The militant Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, also rejected the deal which it said aimed \"to liquidate the Palestinian national project\". And Mr Netanyahu? The Israeli prime minister described Mr Trump\\'s plan as the \"deal of the century\". Israel \"will not miss this opportunity\", Mr Netanyahu said. \"May God bless us all with security, prosperity and peace!\" he added. In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu said that over time the Palestinians would \"see they\\'ll never get a better deal\". How about international reaction? A spokesman for United Nations Secretary General António Guterres said its positions had been defined by relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. \"The United Nations remains committed to supporting Palestinians and Israelis to resolve the conflict on the basis of United Nations resolutions, international law and bilateral agreements and realising the vision of two states - Israel and Palestine - living side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, on the basis of the pre-1967 lines,\" he added. Saudi Arabia and Egypt welcomed President Trump\\'s efforts and called on Israel and the Palestinians to resume negotiations. Jordan said the only path to peace was to establish an independent Palestinian state, based on pre-1967 boundaries, while Turkey\\'s foreign ministry dismissed Mr Trump\\'s proposals as an \"annexation plan\" aimed, it said, at killing a two-state solution and stealing Palestinian land for money. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged the Palestinians to give the plans \"genuine and fair consideration and explore whether they might prove a first step on the road back to negotiations\". What are Trump\\'s key proposals? Mr Trump also indicated that the West Bank would not be cut in half under the plan. \"We will also work to create a contiguous territory within the future Palestinian state, for when the conditions for statehood are met, including the firm rejection of terrorism,\" he said. Israeli and Palestinian media react By BBC Monitoring Palestinian media unequivocally condemned the plan. \"No Palestinian will either accept it or agree to engage with it,\" said Palestinian Authority newspaper Al-Hayat al-Jadidah. The Hamas-run Filastin online said: \"There is no full half of the deal of century because the entire bottle is empty.\" Israeli opinion diverged along political lines with right-leaning media applauding the \"historic move\". The pro-Netanyahu paper Yisrael Hayom said: \"It would be a sin if we didn\\'t support it and immediately apply Israeli sovereignty to Israeli settlements.\" Other outlets had greater sympathy for the Palestinian cause and noted that however well Mr Netanyahu\\'s annexation plans played to his supporters in Israel\\'s upcoming general election, he would soon stand trial on charges of corruption. \"Netanyahu\\'s drama is inconceivable: on the day he gets a green light to realise his wet dream, to annex as he wishes... a harsh indictment is filed,\" said one commentator in the liberal newspaper Haaretz. \"He will not escape his fate.\" What\\'s the background? The Palestinians broke off contacts with the Trump administration in December 2017, after Mr Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel\\'s capital and move the US embassy to the city from Tel Aviv. Since then, the US has ended both bilateral aid for Palestinians and contributions for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). In November, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US had abandoned its four-decades-old position that Jewish settlements in the West Bank were inconsistent with international law. What are the issues at stake? Of all the conflicts in the Middle East, that between Israel and the Palestinians has been the most intractable. Although the two sides signed a peace accord in 1993, more than a quarter of a century on they are arguably as far apart as ever. Jerusalem: Both Israel and the Palestinians hold competing claims to the city. Israel, which occupied the formerly Jordanian-held eastern part in 1967, regards the whole of Jerusalem as its capital. The Palestinians insist on East Jerusalem - home to about 350,000 of their community - as their future capital Palestinian statehood: The Palestinians want an independent state of their own, comprising the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. Israeli prime ministers have publicly accepted the notion of a Palestinian state alongside Israel - but not what form it should take. Benjamin Netanyahu has said any Palestinian state should be demilitarised with the powers to govern itself but not to threaten Israel. Recognition: Israel insists that any peace deal must include Palestinian recognition of it as the \"nation-state of the Jewish people\", arguing that without this Palestinians will continue to press their own national claims to the land, causing the conflict to endure. The Palestinians say what Israel calls itself is its own business, but to recognise it as the Jewish state will discriminate against Israel\\'s Arab population of Palestinian origin, who are Muslims, Christians and Druze. Borders: Both sides have fundamentally different ideas as to where the boundaries of a potential Palestinian state should be. The Palestinians insist on borders based on ceasefire lines which separated Israel and East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza between 1949 and 1967. Israel says those lines are militarily indefensible and were never intended to be permanent. It has not said where borders should be, other than making clear its own eastern border should be along the Jordan River. Settlements: Since 1967, Israel has built about 140 settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as 121 outposts - settlements built without the government\\'s authorisation. Settlements are considered illegal by most of the international community, though Israel disputes this. Palestinians say all settlements must be removed for a Palestinian state to be viable. Mr Netanyahu has vowed not only to never to uproot any settlements but to bring them under Israeli sovereignty. Refugees: The UN says its agencies support about 5.5 million Palestinian refugees in the Middle East (the Palestinian Authority says there are up to 6 million), including the descendants of people who fled or were expelled by Jewish forces from what became Israel in the 1948-49 war. Palestinians insist on their right to return to their former homes, but Israel says they are not entitled to, noting that such a move would overwhelm it demographically and lead to its end as a Jewish state.'}\n\t {'article': 'The Kerem Shalom commercial crossing and the Erez transit point were reopened on Sunday morning. The past week has seen increased violence. Israel retaliated for the rocket attack by Palestinian militants in Gaza, and three Palestinians died in border protests. The reopening of the crossings came amid mediation efforts by Egypt. Restrictions on fishing off the coast of Hamas-ruled Gaza have also been lifted, the Times of Israel reports. But the fragility of the \"calm\" negotiated by Egypt was illustrated by further overnight firing, though no-one was hurt. Israel said five rockets were launched from Gaza at the Eshkol region but it has not been confirmed which group carried out the attack. Israel fired on Hamas posts in response. The rocket attack which prompted Monday\\'s border closure and the Israeli military response struck a house in a village near Tel Aviv leaving seven people injured. Tens of thousands of Palestinians protested along the Gaza border on Saturday, marking one year since the start of border demonstrations. The protests are to push for the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to ancestral homes in what is now Israel. According to Palestinian officials, three protesters were shot dead by Israeli troops during the protests, and another another was killed earlier on Saturday. The Israeli Defense Forces said explosive devices had been thrown over the border fence. Israeli forces had responded with \"riot dispersal means\" and live bullets. Israel says Hamas is a terrorist group and accuses it of using the demonstrations as a cover to cross into its territory and carry out attacks. According to the UN, at least 189 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed in similar protests between March and December 2018. The latest Egyptian-mediated negotiation saw Hamas agree to ensuring the protests do not escalate in return for Israel allowing the flow of goods across the Gaza border to resume, Palestinian officials say.'}\n","output_type":"stream"}]}]}
